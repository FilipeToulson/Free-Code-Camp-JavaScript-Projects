# Free Code Camp JavaScript Projects
### About
Even though I learned to program with JavaScript through Treehouse ([teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/)), I decided to complete these challenges in order to keep my practice up with JavaScript. These projects also allow me to obatin the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification at Free Code Camp, which can be found here [learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). My profile can be found here

Each project involves implementing a specific algorithm. The implementation is then checked with test inputs and expected
results.

### Projects
#### Palindrome Checker
This involved implementing an algorithm that returns true if a string is a palindrome (a string that is spelled the same left
to right and right to left), and false if it isn't.

#### Roman Numeral Converter
This involved implementing an algorithm which converted a given integer to its corresponding roman numberal.

#### Caesars Cipher
This involved implementing a ROT13 algorithm.

#### Telephone Number Validator
This involved implementing an algorithm that returned true if the string provided was a valid American phone number, and false
otherwise.

My solution to this project could have been made simpler through the use of a more complex regular expression to check the phone number provided. This, however, would have turned the project into an exercise in writing regular expressions and not
JavaScript. For this reason I only used regular expressions to remove certain characters from strings, which increases
the amount of JavaScript I had to use.
